# HTML character references.

Note that the official recommendation is to not use character entities and to
instead use the unicode directly in the source. This is fine, but sometimes it's
easier to remember an entitiy reference than to copy/paste or type a unicode
char.

It's also useful to assign these to variables. I use unicode chars for bullets
and stuff in my design, so it's nice to swap &bull; for &rarr; easily.

INSTALL:

  install beautifulsoup 4

RUNNING:

  python chars.py will create .less and .json files.
